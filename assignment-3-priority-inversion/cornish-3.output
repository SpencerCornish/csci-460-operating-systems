The value of time n is the time that the job started it's current processing cycle. So, if a job is interrupted,
it prints its start time for that iteration. When the job eventually completes, n is when this processing period
started, after the job had been interrupted.

Preset list output:

    time 1, t₃33t₃  [job UID: 0, arrival time: 1]
    time 3, t₂NNNNNNNNNNt₂  [job UID: 1, arrival time: 3]
    time 13, t₂NNNNNNNNNNt₂  [job UID: 4, arrival time: 10]
    time 23, t₃333t₃  [job UID: 0, arrival time: 1]
    time 24, t₁111t₁  [job UID: 3, arrival time: 8]
    time 27, t₁111t₁  [job UID: 6, arrival time: 26]
    time 30, t₃333t₃  [job UID: 2, arrival time: 6]
    time 33, t₃333t₃  [job UID: 5, arrival time: 12]


Random output:

    time 1, t₁111t₁  [job UID: 9, arrival time: 1]
    time 4, t₃333t₃  [job UID: 5, arrival time: 2]
    time 7, t₃333t₃  [job UID: 2, arrival time: 4]
    time 10, t₃33t₃  [job UID: 8, arrival time: 5]
    time 12, t₂NNNNNNNNNNt₂  [job UID: 6, arrival time: 12]
    time 22, t₂NNNNNNNNNNt₂  [job UID: 1, arrival time: 19]
    time 32, t₂NNNNNNNNNNt₂  [job UID: 0, arrival time: 24]
    time 42, t₃333t₃  [job UID: 8, arrival time: 5]
    time 43, t₁111t₁  [job UID: 3, arrival time: 27]
    time 46, t₃333t₃  [job UID: 4, arrival time: 11]
    time 49, t₃333t₃  [job UID: 7, arrival time: 12]

Pretty severe inversion can be seen for the random example with uids 8, 6, 1, 0 and 3
